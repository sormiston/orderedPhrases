## Thank you!!

Thanks for the challenge, Kris.  I typically defer to React when something that involves this amount of interactivity and dynamic rendering ... so it was a nice "back to roots" challenge to do this in vanilla JS.

I would publish to Github Pages to give you a shortcut to a live demo, but that's only a feature of either paid github or public repos.  My only request is that I please be allowed to make this repo public, after the interview process, and after it's been scrubbed for any mention to Voces Digital.

>Build a simple game to put the following statements in order. They are listed in the correct order, so they should be shuffled at the start of the game. Once the options are sorted, the game should check the order and let the user know if it is correct or incorrect. It should also store and display their results in an array. This should be done in vanilla JavaScript. Please use easily readable variable names and comment your code as necessary.
```
var questions = {};
questions['q1'] = 'Hay un muchacho y una muchacha en la clase de matemáticas.';
questions['q2'] = 'El maestro dice que los estudiantes necesitan un lápiz.';
questions['q3'] = 'Camila no tiene papel y Mateo tiene papel.';
questions['q4'] = 'Camila no tiene un libro de matemáticas y necesita un libro.';
questions['q5'] = 'Mateo no tiene un lápiz, no tiene una hoja de papel, y no tiene un libro.';
questions['q6'] = 'El maestro está furioso.';
```
